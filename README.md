# advent-of-code
A repository relating to my attempts to complete the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) coding challenge.

## Update: December 11th, 2021

Since I'm rather out of touch with my programming skills, I decided to put the Advent of Code 2021 on hold. I'll revisit the challenges again in the future when I have the reasonable means to complete them. As a Mechanical Engineer with past programming experience, brushing up on my coding knowledge hasn't necessarily been a priority. I plan on tackling some more intermediate difficulty challenges in the meantime as a way to get back into the swing of things.

Thanks again to [Dawson](https://github.com/dwahme) for the help in my final few days attempting the challenge.
